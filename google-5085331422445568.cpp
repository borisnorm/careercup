// Answer:
//	Dijkstra Algorithm is not for TSP, why would you expect to solve NP-hard problems with O(n ^ 2) efforts?
// Comment:
//	1. Difficult question.
//	2. Vague description.
//	3. Strange indication.
//	4. Stupid discussion.
// Based on the judgement above, I believe that 'guy' is a complete amateur. Excellent programmers don't ask stupid questions, but he did.
// The reason I'm complaining is that, he pretended to have google interview experience and posted a lot of fake questions only to trick us.
// He doesn't even know how to calculate the distance between two points?
// He doesn't know what volatile means.
// He keeps asking stupid questions.
// SO HOW THE HELL DOES THIS 'GUY' HAVE SO MANY GOOGLE INTERVIEWS?
// He's site reliability engineer at Boeing, really?
// I hate liars, especially foolish liars!
// Down vote for every question he posted.
