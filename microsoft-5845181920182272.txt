Answer:
	All three baskets are wrongly labeled, thus the "mixed" one is either apple or orange.
	If the "mixed" basket is orange, the "apple" basket can't be orange, it must mixed. The "orange" must be apple.
		mixed -> orange
		orange -> apple
		apple -> mixed
	If the "mixed" basket is apple, the "orange" basket can't be apple, it must mixed. The "apple" must be orange.
		mixed -> apple
		orange -> mixed
		apple -> orange
