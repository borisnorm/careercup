Answer:
	A location on the map may change, thus using the pair of <latitude, longitude> to be the unique id is not a good id.
	Maybe using an auto-increment id is better.
	A HashMap<int, Coordinate> which maps the auto-increment id to the coordinate will allow us to change the coordinates as necessary.
	By the way, what kind of knowledge are these questions try to test? IQ, experience or inspiration?
